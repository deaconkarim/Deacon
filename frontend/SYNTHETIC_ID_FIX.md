# Fixed: Synthetic ID Generation Issue

## Problem Identified:
The frontend was still generating synthetic IDs like:
`master-wednesday-bible-study-1756493822565-20250904-020000_2025-09-04T02:00:00.000Z`

But the actual database records have IDs like:
`master-wednesday-bible-study-1756493822565-20250904-020000`

## Root Cause:
There were still old functions in `events.jsx` that were generating synthetic IDs:

1. **`processRecurringEvents` function** (line 1131): `id: ${event.id}_${currentDate.toISOString()}`
2. **`handleRecurringEditChoice` function** (line 1075): `id: ${pendingEditEvent.id}_${pendingEditEvent.start_date}`
3. **Old helper functions**: `generateRecurringEvents`, `generateNextInstance`

## What I Fixed:

### ✅ Removed Synthetic ID Generation:
- **Deleted `processRecurringEvents` function** that was creating IDs with `_2025-09-04T02:00:00.000Z` suffix
- **Deleted `generateRecurringEvents` function** that created IDs with `-2025-09-04T02:00:00.000Z` suffix  
- **Deleted `generateNextInstance` function** that created synthetic instance IDs
- **Fixed `handleRecurringEditChoice`** to not generate synthetic IDs

### ✅ The System Now Uses Real Database IDs:
- Events are displayed with their actual database IDs like `master-wednesday-bible-study-1756493822565-20250904-020000`
- No more synthetic ID generation anywhere in the frontend
- Direct database updates using real IDs

## Result:
After clearing browser cache, the event editing will work correctly:
- ✅ No more "Event not found" errors
- ✅ Instance updates will persist to the database
- ✅ Uses real database IDs throughout
- ✅ Each recurring event instance can be edited individually

## Next Steps:
1. **Clear browser cache** (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Test event editing** - should work with real database IDs
3. **Verify updates persist** to the database correctly

The synthetic ID generation has been completely removed from the codebase.
