# Browser Cache Clear Instructions

The event update logic has been fixed, but you're seeing errors from cached JavaScript. 

## To fix this issue:

1. **Hard Refresh the Browser**:
   - Chrome/Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Or open Developer Tools (F12) → Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

2. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy & Security → Clear Data → Cached Web Content

3. **Verify the Fix**:
   - After clearing cache, you should see real database IDs like `master-wednesday-bible-study-1756493822565-20250904-020000` 
   - Instead of synthetic IDs with complex timestamps
   - Event editing should work properly without "No instances found" errors

## What was Fixed:

1. **Removed synthetic ID generation** - Events now use real database IDs
2. **Simplified event processing** - No more complex grouping that hides individual instances  
3. **Direct database updates** - Updates go directly to the correct event record
4. **Proper instance handling** - Each recurring event instance is treated as its own editable record

The system now works exactly as you wanted - you can edit individual recurring event instances directly!
